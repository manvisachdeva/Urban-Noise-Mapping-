# Urban-Noise-Mapping
This project focuses on monitoring urban noise pollution in real time by visualizing noise levels on an interactive map. It updates every 5 seconds, pulling data from multiple sensors, and provides alerts when noise exceeds certain thresholds, offering insights for managing noise levels in urban areas.
